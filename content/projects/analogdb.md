## About

[AnalogDB](https://analogdb.com) provides a large collection of curated analog photographs to users through a REST API interface. Beyond just returning photos, AnalogDB enables discovery of similar images, adds keyword labels, extracts dominant colors, and allows for filtering, sorting and searching across all images.

## Design

AnalogDB makes use of several technologies and services to enable a full featured product.

<br/><br/>

Data is scraped from reddit and ingested with a python scraping service built on top of [praw](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw). In addition to scraping, this service is responsible for transforming raw images, extraction of keywords and colors, uploading to [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), and creation of resources through the backend api. Images from S3 are served from [CloudFront CDN](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) for quick and reliable delievery.

The core backend application is written in Go and makes use of [chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) as the HTTP router. It exposes handlers that are responsible for parsing authentication headers, filtering incoming requests, querying databases, and returning JSON responses. Upon upload, all images are transformed with the [ResNet-50 CNN](https://datagen.tech/guides/computer-vision/resnet-50/) to create embeddings which are stored in a [Weaviate](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate) vector database. The backend is packaged as several docker containers and hosted on a VPS.

The frontend web application is built with [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/), making use of server-side rendering and incremental static regeneration for quick loading pages. [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) is utilized for state management. All styles are built from scratch with [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules).
