## About

I'm currently a design engineer at Sensata Technologies working to create new wireless IoT products. In the past I've also worked at Solchroma Technologies and Precision Nanosystems. 

I graduated from Tufts University in 2021 with a degree in mechanical engineering, where I focused on mechatronics, robotics and product design.

In my free time I can be found tinkering with virtual machines and networking in my homelab, taking pictures with my Nikon FM2 and struggling to make par on the golf course. One of my greatest strengths is that I'm pretty good at yoyoing. One of my weaknesses is how easily I fall down Wikapedia rabbit holes.
