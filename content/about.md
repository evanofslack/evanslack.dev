## About

I'm currently a software engineer at [Wasabi](https://wasabi.com) working on cloud object storage. Previously I've worked at [Sensata](https://www.sensata.com/), [Solchroma](https://www.solchroma.com/) and [Precision Nanosystems](https://www.precisionnanosystems.com/).

I graduated from Tufts University in 2021 with a degree in mechanical engineering, where I focused on mechatronics, robotics and product design.

In my free time I can be found tinkering with virtual machines and networks in my homelab, taking pictures with my Nikon FM2 and struggling to make par on the golf course. One of my greatest strengths is that I'm pretty good at yoyoing. One of my weaknesses is how easily I fall down Wikipedia rabbit holes.

If you'd like to collaborate or just chat, please don't hesitate to reach out.
